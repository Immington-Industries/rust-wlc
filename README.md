Rust bindings for [wlc](https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc), the Wayland compositor library.

Bindings are compatable with [wlc](https:://github.com/Cloudef/wlc) v0.0.5 - v0.0.7. 
We suggest using 0.0.7 - it has bugfixes and compatibilty with more recent Wayland protocols.

### Rust Example

```rust
// For more functional example see example/src/main.rs

extern crate rustwlc;
use rustwlc::types::*;
use rustwlc::callback;
use rustwlc::WlcView;

// Callbacks must be labeled extern as they will be called from C
extern "C" fn view_created(view: WlcView) -> bool {
    view.bring_to_front();
    view.focus();
    return true;
}

extern "C" fn view_focus(view: WlcView, focused: bool) {
    view.set_state(VIEW_ACTIVATED, focused);
}

fn main() {
    callback::view_created(view_created);
    callback::view_focus(view_focus);

    // The default log handler will print wlc logs to stdout
    rustwlc::log_set_default_handler();
    let run_fn = rustwlc::init().expect("Unable to initialize!");
    run_fn();
}
```

### Usage
We're on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rustwlc), so to use the library simply add:

```toml
[depdenencies]
rustwlc = "0.5"
```
to your Cargo.toml.

You also need to setup the wlc library so that rust-wlc can see it. If you simply install the library, that will be sufficient.

Note that wlc is prone to backwards-incompatable changes. Whenever this happens we bump a minor version, so make sure to specify the exact minor version in your `Cargo.toml`. We expect our version numbers to keep drifing away from each other until wlc stabilizes. Please be careful as updating wlc could break rustwlc. We will try to stay as close to upstream as possible.

If you are looking to use a custom version of wlc (to ensure compatiblity by building against a specific version or to build the library with debug symbols for example), then you simply need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to the full path of the share library object file (.so). To verify that the correct shared library is seen by rust-wlc, use the `ldd` utility to view the full paths of shared libraries, the entry that starts with "libwlc.so" should point to your custom path.

So if you wlc install is at `/opt/wlc`, then the full path will probably be `/opt/wlc/target/src`. Notice that we only include the directory that containts the .so, not the .so itself. For more information on using DLLs in Linux, see [this link](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html#AEN77).

### Documentation
At the moment, we have Cargo documentation hosted at [our github.io site](http://immington-industries.github.io). 
You can also generate it with cargo doc:
```shell
$ git clone "https://github.com/ImmingtonIndustries/rust-wlc.git"
$ cd rust-wlc
$ cargo doc
```
If the documentation isn't clear enough or in the wrong places, please let us know.

### Safety
`rust-wlc` is written to be a clean Rust wrapper around wlc. While we've taken the liberty to make the code more Rust-friendly (such as creating instance methods for `WlcView` and `WlcOutput`), but we do not try to extend wlc itself. 

The callbacks registered in `callbacks` must be labeled `extern` (or `extern "C"`) because they are called from C code. In addition, as per the Rust spec, panicking from C is undefined behavior (although it's worked for us).

Compositors using rustwlc can do so without any `unsafe` code. We have provided the option to use a Rust callback to handle logging (instead of a method taking in a `*const c_char`). There is also `println!`-powered default enabled with `rustwlc::log_set_default_handler()`. In addition, the methods `get_user_data` and `set_user_data` in `WlcView` and `WlcOutput` are unsafe because they use C raw types (`void*`) underneath, and proper usage requires a deeper understanding of wlc itself.

We have some (WIP) Wayland bindings using the `wayland-sys` crate which can be enabled with the `wlc-wayland` feature. This allows access to Wayland from wlc using the Rust crate `wayland-sys`. This is not a requirement for a basic compositor, however, for some complex features (we used it to directly draw backgrounds onto a view in way-cooler) it may be needed.

## Contributing
We accept pull requests! If you find a bug or would like to contribute (wlc isn't versioned, we may be a few commits behind their API) please submit an issue/pull request.
